# Up-Hill

## By Christina Georgina Rossetti

\

Does the road wind up-hill all the way?

_Yes, to the very end._

Will the day's journey take the whole long day?

_From morn to night, my friend._

\
But is there for the night a resting-place?

_A roof for when the slow dark hours begin._
 
May not the darkness hide it from my face?

_You cannot miss that inn._

\
Shall I meet other wayfarers at night?

_Those who have gone before._

Then must I knock, or call when just in sight?

_They will not keep you standing at that door._

\
Shall I find comfort, travel-sore and weak?

_Of labour you shall find the sum._

Will there be beds for me and all who seek?

_Yea, beds for all who come._
